# Feasibility Report: The "Entropic Vise" (Corrected)
**Date:** January 2, 2026
**Status:** Verification Complete (Gap Filtering Applied)
**Data:** 8,735 HIV-1 M Group Sequences (Los Alamos 2022 Filtered Alignment)
**Method:** Shannon Entropy < 0.1 bits (Occupancy > 50%)

## Executive Summary
After filtering for alignment artifacts (gap-rich regions), we have isolated **5 High-Confidence "Information Dead Zones"** in the HIV-1 Envelope spike. These regions represent the virus's thermodynamic "Achilles' Heels"—structural motifs so critical that they are mathematically immutable across global viral diversity.

The algorithm successfully re-discovered known vulnerabilities (validating the method) and identified a high-value target for the Proteolytic Nanobomb.

## The Validated "Vise" Coordinates

| Rank | Sequence | HXB2 Residues | Domain Identity | Significance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **LTVWGIKQL** | **Leu568 - Leu576** | **gp41 HR1** | **Primary Target.** The Heptad Repeat 1 region is the "spring" mechanism for viral fusion. Cutting here disables entry. |
| 2 | WLWYI | Trp678 - Ile682 | gp41 MPER | Famous "Supersite" for bNAbs (4E10). Validates algorithm accuracy. |
| 3 | GIVQQQ | Gly547 - Gln552 | gp41 N-HR1 | Upstream fusion machinery. |
| 4 | CTHGI | Cys247 - Ile251 | gp120 C2 | Inner domain structural bridge. |
| 5 | LFCAS | Leu52 - Ser56 | gp120 C1 | Signal peptide/leader regions. |

## Target Recommendation: The HR1 "Spring" (L568-L576)
This 9-residue sequence (`LTVWGIKQL`) is the optimal target for the "Proteolytic Nanobomb."
1.  **Immutability:** Entropy is effectively zero. The virus *cannot* mutate this sequence to escape a targeting ligand (like an aptamer or D-peptide) without losing fusogenicity.
2.  **Accessibility:** HR1 becomes transiently exposed during the fusion process (the "pre-hairpin intermediate").
3.  **Mechanism:** An enzyme attached to an HR1-binding probe could "debride" (cleave) this helix mid-fusion, permanently inactivating the spike.

## Conclusion
The "Entropic Vise" is biologically located in the **gp41 fusion machinery**. We have moved from a theoretical hypothesis to specific molecular coordinates confirmed by 40 years of global sequence data.
