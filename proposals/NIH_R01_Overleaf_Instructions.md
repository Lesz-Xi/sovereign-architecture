# How to Publish via Overleaf

Your NIH R01 Proposal has been converted to LaTeX.
Follow these steps to generate the official PDF:

1.  **Go to Overleaf:** [https://www.overleaf.com](https://www.overleaf.com)
2.  **New Project:** Click "New Project" -> "Blank Project". Give it a name (e.g., "Sovereign_R01_Submission").
3.  **Upload File:** 
    *   Click the "Upload" icon (top left).
    *   Drag and drop the `main.tex` file located at:
        `/Users/lesz/Documents/academic-integrity-agent/Caste_Study/sovereign-architecture/proposals/main.tex`
4.  **Set as Main:**
    *   If you see a `main.tex` already there (created by Overleaf), verify it's ours. If not, delete the default one and rename ours to `main.tex`.
5.  **Compile:** Click the green "Recompile" button.

## Contents of the Proposal
The `main.tex` file includes:
*   **Specific Aims:** Condenses the three pillars (Entropy, GAN, Zero-Trust) into the standard 1-page NIH format.
*   **Significance:** Argues for "Physics over Biology."
*   **Approach:** Detailed methods for SELEX, GAN training, and Mouse Models.
