**Query:**
I am the Principal Investigator for a new HIV eradication initiative called "The Sovereign Architecture." I need you to generate a comprehensive **Research Proposal** (NIH R01 style) regarding the following three novel implementations.

**Project Title:** The Sovereign Defense Architecture: A First-Principles Approach to Viral Eradication via Thermodynamics, Adversarial AI, and Zero-Trust Forensics.

**Core Philosophy:** Transitioning from reactive biology to proactive physics-based defense.

**The Three Specific Aims:**

**Aim 1: The "Entropic Vise" (Thermodynamic Targeting)**
*   **Hypothesis:** HIV-1 contains "Thermodynamic Dead Zones" where mutation is physically impossible due to energy constraints (Shannon Entropy $\approx$ 0).
*   **Target:** We have computationally identified **gp41 HR1 (Residues 568-576: `LTVWGIKQL`)** as the primary immutable region.
*   **Methodology:** Use a "Proteolytic Nanobomb" (Aptamer-Protease Chimera) to bind this region during the pre-hairpin fusion state and cleave it.
*   **Request:** Validate the biophysics of HR1 immutability and propose specific aptamer selection protocols (SELEX) for this hydrophobic pocket.

**Aim 2: "Algorithmic Immunity" (Adversarial Prediction)**
*   **Hypothesis:** Standard AI models fail to predict viral evolution because they ignore thermodynamic laws.
*   **Innovation:** We have designed a **Thermodynamically Constrained GAN (TC-GAN)**.
*   **Mechanism:** A Dual-Discriminator system where the "Physics Discriminator" applies an infinite loss penalty if the Generator dares to mutate the "Entropic Vise" (HR1).
*   **Goal:** Force the AI to predict high-probability escape mutants that *respect* physical constraints, creating a library of "Future Viruses" for preemptive vaccine design.

**Aim 3: "Zero-Trust Bio-Forensics" (Latency Detection)**
*   **Hypothesis:** The "Shock and Kill" cure strategy fails because measuring the latent reservoir is impossible. We need continuous intrusion detection.
*   **Innovation:** **"Epigenetic Honeytokens"** (Sentinel Cells).
*   **Mechanism:** Engineer autologous T-cells with a **Tat-Responsive Promoter (LTR)** driving a secreted reporter (e.g., Gaussia Luciferase). Implant these cells into the patient.
*   **Logic:** If a latent virus wakes up anywhere in the body, it releases Tat. Tat enters the Sentinel and triggers the "Alarm" (bioluminescence) before viral rebound occurs.
*   **Request:** Assess the feasibility of using "SynNotch" or standard Tat-sensing circuits for in vivo surveillance.

**Output Requirement:**
Please writing the Full Research Proposal including:
1.  **Significance:** Why this First-Principles approach solves the 40-year deadlock.
2.  **Innovation:** The combination of Information Theory, Generative AI, and Cytometric Surveillance.
3.  **Approach:** Detailed experimental design for the three aims above.
