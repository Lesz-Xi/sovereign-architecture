# The Sovereign Architecture
**A First-Principles Defense System Against Viral Hyper-Mutation**

## Overview
This repository contains the source code, design specifications, and feasibility reports for the "Sovereign Architecture," a three-part system designed to eradicate HIV-1 by targeting its physical constraints rather than its biological manifestations.

## Repository Structure

### 1. The Trap (`/1_the_trap`)
**Objective:** Thermodynamic Targeting of Immutable Regions.
*   `core_algorithms/`: Python scripts for Shannon Entropy analysis and Gap Filtering.
*   `visualization/`: PyMOL scripts (`.pml`) for mapping "Dead Zones" to PDB:5FUU.
*   `Entropic_Vise_Summary.md`: Final report on the discovery of the HR1 "Vise."

### 2. The Oracle (`/2_the_oracle`)
**Objective:** Predictive "Algorithmic Immunity."
*   `models/`: PyTorch prototypes for the **Thermodynamically Constrained GAN (TC-GAN)**.
*   `Algorithmic_Immunity_Design.md`: Technical specification for the Dual-Discriminator architecture.

### 3. The Watchman (`/3_the_watchman`)
**Objective:** Zero-Trust Bio-Forensics (Latency Detection).
*   `designs/`: Conceptual frameworks for "Epigenetic Honeytokens" (Sentinel Cells).
*   `Zero_Trust_Feasibility.md`: Literature validation of Tat-based sensor implants.

### 4. Proposals (`/proposals`)
*   `Sovereign_Architecture_Grant_Proposal.md`: The 36-month "Manhattan Project" funding roadmap.

## Usage
### Running the TC-GAN Prototype
To test the "Thermodynamic Discriminator":
```bash
python3 2_the_oracle/models/TC_GAN_Prototype.py
```
