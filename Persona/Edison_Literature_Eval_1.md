Plan summary: We searched for SELEX-derived aptamers against HIV-1 gp41 (HR1/HR2), studies quantifying effects of single amino-acid substitutions on aptamer affinity, reports of viral escape to aptamers, comparative sensitivity of aptamers vs antibodies to point mutations, literature comparing resistance to competitive versus irreversible/mechanism-based inhibitors, protease mutation tolerance data (kcat/Km), and reports of aptamer–enzyme conjugates and resistance. We then attempted to gather evidence from retrieved texts.

Findings

QUERY 1: APTAMER BINDING vs. MUTATION ESCAPE

SELEX aptamers to HIV-1 gp41 (HR1/HR2)
Evidence found that SELEX-derived aptamers against HIV-1 envelope proteins include not only gp120 but also reports indicating selection against whole HIV-1 that yielded binders to gp120 and gp41. However, epitope mapping to HR1 vs HR2 was not provided in the accessible excerpt, and no quantified Kd values for gp41-directed aptamers were available in the retrieved context (review summary). (1.1)
Effects of point mutations in protein targets on aptamer affinity (Kd)
No qualifying primary data with quantified Kd fold-changes for protein point mutants versus aptamer binding were available in the retrieved context.
Viral “aptamer escape” mutations (HIV, HCV, influenza, etc.)
No qualifying primary data describing viral escape mutations selected against aptamer therapeutics were available in the retrieved context.
Aptamer vs antibody sensitivity to point mutations
No qualifying comparative studies were available in the retrieved context.
QUERY 2: PROTEOLYTIC CLEAVAGE vs. COMPETITIVE INHIBITION 5) Competitive inhibitors vs irreversible/mechanism-based therapeutics and resistance

No qualifying comparative resistance literature was available in the retrieved context.
Protease substrate specificity and mutation tolerance (cathepsins, MMPs)
No qualifying primary kinetic examples (kcat/Km) for cleavage of mutant substrates were available in the retrieved context.
Suicide substrate/mechanism-based inhibitor resistance profiles
No qualifying primary resistance profiles were available in the retrieved context.
Aptamer–enzyme conjugates (protease or nuclease) and resistance
No qualifying therapeutic aptamer–protease or aptamer–nuclease conjugate resistance data were available in the retrieved context.
Direct check on gp41 HR1 V38A and aptamers

No direct experimental data was found on this specific question.
Conclusion

Based on the single accessible source, SELEX-derived aptamers have been reported against HIV-1 envelope proteins, with indications that selections targeting whole virus have yielded binders to gp41; however, we could not extract primary, gp41 HR1/HR2-epitope-specific aptamer identities, Kd values, or mutation-tolerance data from the retrieved context. Further, we found no directly citable evidence in the current context addressing whether single amino-acid substitutions (e.g., V38A) typically abolish aptamer binding, nor comparative sensitivity of aptamers vs antibodies to point mutations, nor literature comparing resistance development for competitive versus irreversible enzyme strategies, nor protease mutation-tolerance kinetics, nor resistance mechanisms for aptamer–enzyme conjugates. Therefore, whether “V38A mutations would likely disrupt aptamer binding” is currently unproven in the accessible evidence and remains speculative pending direct experimental testing. (1.1)
