# Zero-Trust Bio-Forensics: Feasibility Report
**Date:** January 2, 2026
**Status:** VALIDATED (Technology Exists, Application is Novel)

## 1. The Core Mechanism: "Epigenetic Honeytokens"
The proposal relies on engineering a "Sentinel Cell" that acts as a decoy to detect latent HIV reactivation.
*   **Trigger:** HIV **Tat** protein (released during early reactivation).
*   **Sensor:** An **HIV LTR Promoter** integrated into the Sentinel Cell genome.
*   **Output:** A non-immunogenic, secreted reporter (e.g., **SEAP** or **Gaussia Luciferase**).

## 2. Literature Validation
Our review confirms the individual components are mature technologies:

### A. Tat-Based Sensors
*   **Current State:** Dual-fluorescent reporters (HIV-Tocky, LTR-GFP) are standard in virology labs for sorting latently infected cells *ex vivo*.
*   **Validation:** Tat is known to be released from infected cells and can enter neighboring cells (trans-cellular activation), confirming the "Remote Sensing" capability of our Sentinel.

### B. Sentinel Cell Engineering
*   **Current State:** "Smart Cells" like **SARSNotch** (SynNotch receptors) have been successfully engineered to detect external viral antigens and trigger therapeutic payloads.
*   **Precedent:** CAR-T cells prove that engineered immune cells can persist in the body for years (Long-term Surveillance).

## 3. The Innovation Gap
While the *parts* exist, the *strategy* is novel.
*   **Old Strategy:** "Shock and Kill" (Wake up everything and try to kill it). Risk: Toxicity.
*   **New "Zero-Trust" Strategy:** "Continuous Audit."
    *   Implant Sentinel Cells.
    *   If the Reservoir wakes up (spontaneous blip), the Sentinel glows.
    *   Outcome: We detect "The Breach" (Rebound) days/weeks before viral load becomes detectable in blood PCR.

## 4. Conclusion
"Zero-Trust Bio-Forensics" is feasible. It requires re-purposing existing "Lab Tools" (Tat sensors) into "Clinical Implants" (Honeytokens). This shifts the paradigm from "Eradication" (impossible?) to "Radical Transparency" (Sovereign Monitoring).
